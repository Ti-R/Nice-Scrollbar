# Nice-Scrollbar
Nice scrolling Bar for browser on PC (mouse and touch events) and on Smartphones (touch events). Big and slim, easy to integrate. Tested on Firefox/Chrome/Maxthon/iPhone/Android.

# Reason
I needed a scrolling library for this personal website, and because I couldn't find a good one fitting all my needs, I just create my own :)

# Infos

 - Scrolling working on Smartphone with the finder on the div you need to scroll.
 - Automatic adaptive scrolling even if content will appear later.
 - You can use a mouse on PC to move the scrollbar.
 - You can click inside the scrollbar to move quickly top or down.
 - You can use the scrolling button of the mouse to scroll content.
 - You can use scrolling content inside scrolling content.
